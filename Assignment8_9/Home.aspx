        <h2>
            Photography is a way to capture the moments in our lives that we wish to remember. 
        </h2>

        <h2>
            Not only is photography my passion, but it brings me joy to offer
            others images of those memories that brought them complete happiness. I 
            believe that by allowing my customers to choose where they would like their 
            pictures taken will help not only make the photo session
            that much more relaxing but that it makes things more enjoyable as well.

            your photography session should you like to incorporate a theme within your images so 
            please don't hesitate to ask.
